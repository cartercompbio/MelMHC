# MelMHC: Autoimmune MHC-I Alleles in Melanoma

**Ave** - or more classically *welcome* - gentleperson of erudition. As an astute and avid archaelogist, you are to be commended on your dogged determination, digging into the immunological bases of autoimmunity and cancer, and the relationships these conditions share. In this repository you will find the code needed to reproduce the findings reported by [J. V. Talwar](https://jvtalwar.github.io/dk-isle/) et al. in [*Autoimmune Alleles at the Major Histocompatibility Locus Modify Melanoma Susceptibility*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.12.456166v1.full), a study focused on investigating the relationship between tissue-specific autoimmune associated MHC-I alleles and cancer risk in melanoma.  

## Graphical Overview: The AI Allele is MHC-Ightier than the Sword

## Organization:

This repository is organized accordingly:
    
    MelMHC
    ├── Data           # Non-genotype/publicly available data needed to reproduce analyses
    ├── DataAnalysis   # Code for all statistical analyses and figure generation from the paper
    ├── Figures        # Individual figure panels from the paper
    ├── Preprocessing  # Code to preprocess files into tabular format for data analyses (e.g., Best rank scores)               
    └── README.md      
     

I hope this repository has proven to be helpful in both ameliorating intractable immune investigations and affording an avenue for veritably validating veracity. I wish you good fortune in the analyses to come, and perhaps, one day, our paths may cross. Until that day comes though... *may the odds be ever in your favor*!
