# MelMHC: Autoimmune MHC-I Alleles in Melanoma

**Ave** - or more classically *welcome* - gentleperson of erudition. As an astute and avid archaelogist, you are to be commended on your dogged determination, digging into the immunological bases of autoimmunity and cancer, and the relationships these conditions share. In this repository you will find the code needed to reproduce the findings reported by Talwar et al. in [*Autoimmune Alleles at the Major Histocompatibility Locus Modify Melanoma Susceptibility*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.12.456166v1.full), a study focused on investigating the relationship between tissue-specific autoimmune associated MHC-I alleles and cancer risk in melanoma.
